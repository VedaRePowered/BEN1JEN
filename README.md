### Hi there
I post most of my projects [on a self hosted gitlab instance](https://gitlab.101100.ca), and sometimes talk about them on [my blog](https://ben1jen.ca).

Hello and welcome to my website, thanks for visiting! My name is Ben and I like programming, I'm in my final year in high school right now and this is my blog to talk about random projects I'm interested in and/or working on.

I don't have any plans to post every week or every day or anything but I'm planning on slowly posting more content over time so on the off chance that you're interested in what you see below be sure to bookmark this page and check back sometime. If you have a question or an idea or just want to say hi be sure to send me an email at my address above or just send me a message on Discord (also above).

Currently this website is very much WIP, simply because I'm creating the site completely from scratch (it's source code is here, by the way). In the future I'm planning on making a lot of improvements, cleaning up the design, optimizing and adding search and category pages, and implementing a tag system, but currently most of that is not yet implemented.
